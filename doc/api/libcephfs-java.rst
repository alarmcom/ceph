Libcephfs (JavaDoc)
===================

..
    The admin/build-docs script runs Ant to build the JavaDoc files, and
    copies them to api/libcephfs-java/javadoc/.

TODO: This page needs to discuss how the Java CephFS bindings are installed
and linked to. This page will then be referred to as instructions on
satisfying the libcephfs-java dependency from the Hadoop CephFS page.

View the auto-generated `JavaDoc pages for the CephFS Java bindings <javadoc/>`_.
